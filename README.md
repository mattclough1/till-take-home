### Overview

Attached you'll find a file, transactions.json . Use the data in this file to create a single-page web app screen which shows the list of transactions. The UI should display:

- For each transaction
  - Amount
  - Whether it was a debit or credit
  - The merchant
  - Details (if any)
  - The account balance after the transaction (the beginning balance is in the data)
  
- Information about the user
  - Name
  - Avatar
  
You can display the data in any way you think is an efficient way for the user to consume the information, quickly.

### Deliverables
A web page built with either React of Vue with the above user interface.

Send the source code, either as a zip file or as a hosted Git repository (e.g. in GitHub)

### Judgement Criteria
- Performance (startup time, smooth interactions)
- Testing
- Modularity/reusability
- Documentation (in code and out of code)
- Delightfulness (did you delight the user in some unique way which doesn't distract from the information)
